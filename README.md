## About

If the Four Noble Truths are what is realised by arahants...

> "Because of not truly seeing the four noble truths, we have transmigrated for a long time from one rebirth to the next. But now that these truths have been seen, the attachment to rebirth is eradicated. The root of suffering is cut off, now there are no more future lives."
>
> \- The Buddha ([DN 16](https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato))

...then the entirity of the Buddhas teachings would stem from the Four Noble Truths, right?

> "The footprints of all creatures that walk can fit inside an elephantâ€™s footprint, so an elephantâ€™s footprint is said to be the biggest of them all. In the same way, all skillful qualities can be included in the four noble truths."
>
> \- Ven. Sariputta ([MN 28](https://suttacentral.net/mn28/en/sujato))

This app is my attempt to illustrate and organise this, while helping me study the suttas of the Pali Canon and practice web development.

_Made with metta while I should have been meditating._
